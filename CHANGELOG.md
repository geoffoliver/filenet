## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Folder browser** — setup wizard and Settings now include a "Browse…" button next to folder path inputs; clicking it opens a modal that lets users navigate their filesystem visually and select a folder, so they never have to type a path manually; the text input remains editable for power users
  - New `GET /api/fs?path=...` endpoint lists subdirectories at a given path (hidden dirs excluded), returns `{ path, parent, home, entries }`, defaults to the user's home directory
  - `FolderPicker` component (modal with breadcrumb nav + scrollable dir list) used in shared-folder add row and download-folder input in both the setup wizard and Settings

- **Docker support** — `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`, and `docker-entrypoint.sh` for self-hosting; runs `prisma db push` on startup, persists the database in a named volume, and exposes the UI (`:3000`) and P2P (`:7734`) ports
  - `SHARED_FOLDERS` (colon-separated paths) and `DOWNLOAD_FOLDER` env vars seed the database on first launch so the setup wizard and Settings page always reflect the container's volume mounts
  - Setup wizard skips the shared-folders and download-folder steps entirely when those env vars are set — those paths are container-internal and can only be changed by editing `docker-compose.yml` and rebuilding
  - Settings → Files section displays env-controlled paths as read-only with an explanatory note; add/remove controls are hidden when the value is provided via environment variable

- **Friends-of-friends auto-accept** — when `autoAcceptFromFriendsOfFriends` is enabled in settings, incoming friend requests from unknown nodes are automatically accepted if any accepted connected peer vouches for them
  - New `friend-vouch-request` / `friend-vouch-response` wire protocol; queries are sent to all currently connected accepted peers with a 3-second timeout
  - Only responses from peers that were explicitly queried are accepted, preventing unsolicited vouch injections
  - Only accepted friends may request or respond to vouches, limiting enumeration attack surface
  - Handled symmetrically on both inbound (server WebSocket) and outbound (client WebSocket) connections

- **Metadata extraction — images, PDFs, EPUBs, and DOCX files** — extended metadata extraction to cover more file types; video metadata extraction fixed to include pixel dimensions, container format, and codec
  - Images (JPEG, PNG, WebP, HEIC, AVIF, TIFF): width, height, camera make/model, date/time via `exifr`; GPS coordinates excluded for privacy
  - PDFs: title, author, subject, keywords, page count via `pdf-parse` v2
  - EPUB ebooks: title, author, language, publisher, description, identifier, published date via `jszip` + OPF XML parsing
  - DOCX documents: title, author, description, keywords, revision via `jszip` + `docProps/core.xml` parsing
  - Video (AVI, MKV, MOV, MP4, etc.): now correctly extracts pixel width/height, container, and codec from track info (previously these were never read)
  - All extractors consolidated in `server/metadata.ts`; `server/indexer.ts` delegates to it
  - PDF, EPUB, and DOCX extractors skip files larger than 50 MB to prevent OOM during indexing
  - All string metadata fields are clamped to 500 characters; search-protocol drops oversized metadata JSON (> 4096 chars) rather than sending a corrupt truncated string

- **Upload stats per friend** — tracks `uploadCount` and `uploadTotalBytes` on each `Friend` row; incremented fire-and-forget whenever a chunk is served to an accepted peer, with in-memory deduplication so each unique file served to each peer counts as one upload; exposed as `uploads: { count, totalSize }` in `GET /api/friends` and shown on the Friends page alongside download stats

- **Active Downloads on Home dashboard** — the Home view now shows a live "Active Downloads" panel that polls every 3 s and renders compact rows (filename, progress bar, state badge, speed, ETA, source count) for any `PENDING`, `DOWNLOADING`, or `PAUSED` transfers, with a "View all" link to the Transfers page; `formatSpeed` and `formatEta` consolidated into `app/lib/api.ts` and shared between Home and Transfers views

- **Post-download scripts** — run user-defined `.ts`/`.js` scripts after each download completes; scripts receive `{ file: BunFile, stats: TransferStats }` and run sequentially in configured order; errors in one script do not block subsequent scripts
  - Settings UI: add, remove, and reorder scripts with up/down controls
  - REST API: `GET/POST /api/scripts`, `PATCH /api/scripts/:id` (reorder), `DELETE /api/scripts/:id`
  - `TransferStats` type exposed for script authors: `downloadId`, `filename`, `sha256`, `size`, `mimeType`, `durationMs`, `bytesReceived`, `maxSources`, `startedAt`, `completedAt`
  - **Schema migration required:** run `bunx prisma db push` to create the `PostDownloadScript` table

- **Listening port configuration** — configure the P2P listening port from Settings; port-forwarding instructions rendered dynamically with the chosen port number; env var `P2P_PORT` still overrides the DB value at startup
  - Setup wizard: new step 5 for port selection + port-forwarding instructions (Preferences moves to step 6)
  - **Schema migration required:** run `bunx prisma db push` to add the `listenPort` column to `Settings`

- **Online presence** — friends page shows a green dot next to connected friends (polling every 5 s); chat sidebar shows a presence dot on DM conversations whose peer is currently online

- **Dashboard download stats** — Home dashboard now shows real "Files downloaded" count and total bytes downloaded from completed transfers; Friends list shows per-friend download count and total size
  - Download counters (`downloadCount`, `downloadTotalBytes`) are denormalized onto the `Friend` row and incremented atomically when a download completes, keeping `GET /api/friends` O(friends) rather than O(completed downloads)
  - Only ACCEPTED friends receive credit; credits are deduplicated per download (a nodeId listed twice in one transfer's sources is counted only once); counters are hidden for non-ACCEPTED friends even if historical data exists (e.g. a friend later blocked)
  - **Schema migration required:** run `bunx prisma db push` to add the `downloadCount` and `downloadTotalBytes` columns to the `Friend` table

## [0.1.0] — 2026-06-03

### Added

- **Chat** — full P2P chat over encrypted WebSockets
  - Direct messages (DM) between two nodes; canonical `dm:{nodeA}:{nodeB}` conversation IDs (sorted) prevent split-history attacks
  - Group conversations with network-wide fan-out; any connected friend receives and auto-joins
  - `ChatMessageSchema` (Zod) validates all inbound peer messages; `senderNodeId` always overrides self-reported `fromNodeId` to prevent spoofing
  - Deduplication inside a DB transaction — replayed `messageId`s cannot create or bump a `Conversation` row
  - Split-pane UI (sidebar + thread + composer); own messages bubble right, peer messages left; 500 ms polling loop
  - New-group modal with ARIA dialog semantics and Escape-to-close
  - Full keyboard navigation on conversation list items (`role="button"`, Enter/Space)
  - REST API: `GET/POST /api/conversations`, `GET/POST /api/conversations/:id/messages`, `DELETE /api/conversations/:id`
  - `GET /api/me` exposes local `nodeId` to the frontend

- **Transfers** (#8) — multi-source chunk-based P2P download system
  - `Download` model; chunk-request / chunk-response / chunk-error wire protocol
  - Parallel multi-source downloading; SHA-256 chunk and whole-file verification
  - Resumable downloads; pause / resume / cancel with partial-file cleanup
  - Transfers UI: upload and download panes with progress bars, speed, remaining time, source count

- **Home dashboard** (#7) — files shared count + size, friends online/total, network size

- **Settings** (#6) — profile name, shared folders, download folder, auto-accept preferences, invite password, manual rescan trigger

- **Search** (#5) — local + network search with filename, file-type, and metadata filtering; result detail expand; network fan-out with TTL and cycle prevention

- **Friends** (#4) — friend list with accept/reject, add-friend form, remove action; password-based auto-accept

- **P2P network search** (#3) — `search-request` / `search-result` wire protocol; results delivered directly back to the requesting node

- **File indexing** (#2) — directory scanner, SHA-256 hashing, metadata extraction (audio/video), periodic background rescan, stale-entry cleanup

- **Friends system + infrastructure** (#1) — Ed25519 identity, X25519 ECDH handshake, AES-256-GCM session encryption, friend-request / friend-response protocol, Prettier, ESLint, pre-commit hooks, GitHub Actions CI
